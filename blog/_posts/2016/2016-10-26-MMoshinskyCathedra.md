### Congratulations to Dr. Enrique Hern√°ndez Lemus, for being awarded the Marcos Moshinsky Cathedra on the field of physics!

The Marcos Moshinsky Cathedra is a yearly award given to Mexican scientists in physics, mathematics, and biochemistry, for developing a research project in their fields of interest. The winners are rigorously selected by renowned Mexican scientists.

The cathedras of research are a permanent homage to the scientific labor of Marcos Moshinsky and a lifetime honor for the awardees. It is expected that, over the years, the awardees form a big family with a common goal: promoting scientific research in Mexico.

#### Academic Background

* Pharmaceutical and biological chemist  UNAM - Faculty of Chemistry.
* Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences - UNAM (Summer 2016).

#### Research Interests

* Search for new therapeutic targets in complex diseases: Complex diseases involve several alterations at different biological levels that lead to the phenotype. This makes finding a single pharmacological target hard. Strategies based on systems biology can be used to integrate omics-scale data, finding deregulated, potentially druggable molecules.

* Classification strategies of complex diseases: Complex diseases are heterogeneous. Not all patients show the same alterations, reflecting in pathological differences. Implementing classification strategies using omics-scale data may help the decision-making process in the clinical setting. Exploring the differences and commonalities between different manifestations of a disease can help us find new drugs, both general and specific to a particular phenotype. 

* Crosstalk phenomena in biological pathways: Biological pathways are not isolated, but in fact may share molecules with each other. Crosstalk between pathways may have effects on the different phenotypes of complex diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, pathway crosstalk may lead to differences in pharmacological response. The study of crosstalk might lead to a better understanding of the pathological processes in disease, and help in the search for new and better therapeutic options.
